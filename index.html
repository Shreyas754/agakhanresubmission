Admission to the Academy is competitive and based on student merit, regardless of a family’s ability to pay. We consider all eligible students regardless of socio-economic status.As with all the Aga Khan Academies, we are committed to excellence in all aspects of education. This commitment includes the academic curriculum as well as the campus where students live and learn. 

Our campus is architect designed and purpose built. It features state-of-the-art classrooms and resource areas, and extensive sports facilities. These outstanding facilities provide an inspiring environment for both students and staff.

At the Academy, we strive to create a balance between academic demands, sports, cultural activities, and community life. We challenge our students to be intellectually inquisitive and socially conscious. We also encourage them to respect and appreciate other people’s cultures, social structures, values and beliefs.

                <span><p id="ewff">The Academy’s residences include facilities to accommodate both students and teachers. Our residences house boarding students requiring accommodation as well as those participating in international exchanges between the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad and other Academies and schools.Teachers' quarters on campus house both resident and visiting faculty. Our residential programme is about the learning and growth that comes through constant interaction with a diverse and talented group of teachers and peers.

Mealtimes and other gatherings provide our residential students with opportunities for informal interaction as well as for discussions, meetings, language tab les and study groups.

The focus of the residential experience is on students’ intellectual, social, spiritual and physical growth in a structured and ethical environment. Many of the least tangible but most important elements of an education – the development of practical leadership skills, the capacity to make ethical judgments, the ability to navigate through complex cultural settings – are formed outside the classroom.

The safe and secure environment of the Academy’s boarding facilities gives students of all backgrounds the opportunity to thrive emotionally, intellectually and physically.</p></span></div>
